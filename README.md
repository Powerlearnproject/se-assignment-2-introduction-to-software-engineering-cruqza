Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:it`s the systematic application of engeneering principles,methods and tools to develop,maintain and high quality software systems

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):software engneering differs from traditional programming in the sense that as it involves structured methodoligies to solve complex problems that emerged in the advent of computers.SDLC refers to the steps undertaken to come up with a software engenering project.


Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.Requirements- refers  to gathering and documenting user needds and system needs;Design - creating high level and detailed designs and user interfaces;implementation- this is the actual code writing and software build according to the specifications in the design; Testing - conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality stardards and functional requirements;deployment -this is releasing the finished product to users/consumers;Maintanance - It involves providing support,updates and enhancements to the software after deployement.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:AGILE model refers to iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibilty,collaboration and responding change; WATERFALL model is sequential approach with distict phases,meaning one thing has to follow each other in sequence

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred? Agile  is iterative and flexible as it does not have to follow a certain squence,it relies on collaboration and respond to change while Waterfall has to follow the outlined sequence of design steps from start to end.Agile is mostly preffered in longterm projects while waterfall is preffered in short-term projects.
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.It refers to indentifying, gathering and documenting user needs and system needs of a software system;itsa very essential phase as it servers as a foundation for design and development of a software that meets a clients need and expectations.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?it refers to breaking down a system software into smaller,independent modules that can be developed and tested and maintained independently; it helpes to isolate changes to a specific module,it eases understanding and resonability to solve a particular problem;it also eases scalibity in the form of parrallel development by different teams,resource management and use of reusable components.
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?  unit testing- involves testing individual components or functions in isolation;integration testing focuses on verifying the interactions between components or modules of the software;system testing -  refers to testing the compelete,intergrated whole system as a unit;acceptance testing -the final level of testing performed deployement of the system to th the customer.testing is important as it ensures quality,reliability,validates requirements and inmproves user satisfaction.
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features. VCS- are tools that help manage changes to source code over time,they help mmultiple developers to collaborate on a project,track changes and maintain record of modifications.they include Git-it has distributed copies of repositories,branching and merging,stangint area for commiting and allow changes befpre commit,speed,community and ecosystem support.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?He/She is responsible for planning,executing and closing software projects within the required time and mantaining quality stardards.He/She is responsible for team management,rissk management,communication,quality assuarance,risk management,monitoring and control,planning,communicatio and project closure.challeges include - time management,unclear requirements,resource constraints.
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?its the process of modifying and updating software applications after the deployement to clients correct faults,improve perfomance or adaptation to a changed environment.its important because it ensures software reliability and performance,enhances user satisfaction,extend software lifespan,adapt the software to changing environment.
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?(i)privacy  concerns(ii) security issues to the system which can lead to client data exposure,(iii) intellectual property(iv)algorithm bias(v)trust issues; software engeneers adhere to stardards by adopting ethical codes,transparency,open communication,stakeholder engagement,legal compliance,undertake privacy methodlogies.
